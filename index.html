 </P><P>Hi, I’m Tom Bradford and I am 32 years old.</p>
<p>I have a background in the trade industry, I am a glazier by trade. I have been working with glass in high rise buildings from the age of 17. I also enlisted in the Royal Australian Regiment for five years from 2008 to 2013. During my enlistment, I was part of a couple operations with 8/9 RAR. I was deployed to East Timor and to Malaysia. I have not studied since I completed grade 11 in high school in 2006.</p>
<p>More recently, I returned from a trip around Australia with my wife. We took a year off work to complete the lap with our 4WD and camper trailer. We had an absolute blast.

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>My interest in IT is just the love of technology and how it helps us and entertains us in a way that just was not possible years ago. I cannot recall a particular event in my life that sparked my interest, I just know that I have always been intrigued by anything technology related. From a very young age I was always into my video games, remote control cars, computers and even playing snake 2 on my Nokia 3315.</p> 
<p>I chose to attend RMIT because I have always regretted not studying after finishing school. It was not something that I considered back in high school, but as I got older, I started to wish I had engaged more in my studies when I was young.  After I took the year off work to travel, I decided now would be the perfect time to complete further study. I researched several IT courses before signing up to study at RMIT, but many of those courses did not appeal to me as they did not appear to lead to practical career options upon completion. I chose to complete a bachelor’s degree to give myself the best opportunity to secure an IT role in the future. Ultimately, I decided to attend RMIT after reading lots of positive reviews.

<h1>Ideal job</h1>
<p><img src="job.PNG"style="float:above;width:450px;"</p>
 <p>My ideal job is in the role of IT Manager with an Australian based company. The role of IT Manager advertised by Robert Half Technology (a recruitment firm) is a great example. This is a role which was recently created to transform IT across the company by building up their IT capability then leading business enablement through technology. The role requires the skills to manage an IT team, provide advice to senior leadership, manage external IT providers and IT project management. This role would suit me because I believe I am a strong leader capable of leading a team of employees. I also believe that I would enjoy performing network upgrades and other innovative things.</p>
<p>Skills required
 <ul>
  <li>	hands on IT management experience.</li>
  <li>Background driving business enablement through technology.</li>
  <li>a good understanding of IT systems and coding.</li>
  <li>	good knowledge of server, networking, security and cloud.</li>
</ul>

</p>
 <p>I am confident in my people skills and leadership skills. However, I acknowledge that I am currently not skilled in the IT components of the role. </p>
 <p>In order to secure a role as an IT Manager, I need to complete my studies and learn all the technical skills required. I will then need to secure an entry level role in a company that requires networking, cloud security and server skills. It will take time to build on my skills and learn all the things necessary to take charge of a team working in the IT field. Once I have the practical skills necessary to perform the role, I will still need to keep climbing the ladder within the company to attain a leadership role. During this time, I will endeavour to continue upskilling and developing my technical and leadership skills. It is likely that I will need to be in a junior leadership role for several years prior to securing a role as IT Manager.</p>
 
 
 <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
 <p><img src="profile.PNG"style="float:above;width:450px;"</p>
 <p>I have recently undertaken a number of tests that may be used by employers during a recruitment process. The tests provided certain insights into my personality and learning style. A brief summary of the results of each test is detailed below.</p>
<h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
 <p>After completing the Myers Briggs test, I got ESFJ-A or “Consul”. The Myers Briggs results were very detailed and included information about how my personality type’s strengths and weaknesses and approach to relationships and my career. Broadly, the test results reflect that Consul’s are popular people, who enjoy being in the spotlight and leading others. People with a Consul personality take responsibility seriously and will base their moral compass on established traditions and law. Consuls enjoy participating in discussion, respect hierarchy and are loyal partners and employees. </p>
 <p>I feel that the result of Consul is an accurate representation of my personality. I do enjoy being of service and consider myself supportive and outgoing. I have the personality type to be a good leader and I am good at managing several projects at one time. </p>
 <p>The results provide a detailed list of strengths and weaknesses, which I believe will influence my behaviour in a team environment. As a positive, I have strong practical skills to offer a team, I am loyal and good at connecting with others. However, I am also inflexible at times, vulnerable to criticism and reluctant to innovate. These weaknesses obviously have the capacity to adversely impact those around me and have a negative influence on my team. By knowing my weaknesses, it will place me in a better position to recognise when I am displaying negative behaviours and work to address these in future. </p>
 <p>In terms of how this will influence forming a team, I believe it is important to assemble a team of people who complement each other. Where I have an identified weakness, it is important to have others within a team that have a strength in that area. </p>
 <h3>My Learning Style</h3>
 <p>In addition to the Myer’s Briggs test, I also took a test to assess my learning style. The results reflect that I am 40% auditory, 40% visual and 20% tactile, meaning that I am an Auditory/Visual Learner and learn through a combination of listening and looking.</p>
  <p>The test provided several tips to assist with auditory learning, including use of flashcards, reading information out loud and recording myself. As I am also a visual learner, the test recommended visualising things as I hear them, writing down key instructions and drawing pictures to explain new concepts.</p>
  <p>My learning style requires both audio and visual prompts. Now that I am aware of this, I can ensure that I utilise the recommendations to ensure I am absorbing information as best I can. Through ensuring I am implementing best practice in my studies, I can ensure I am making the best possible contribution to my team. This will also influence how I form a team as I consider it would be beneficial if all team members had similar learning styles.  </p>
 <h3>Integrity test</h3>
 <p>For the third test that you might be required to complete at a job interview, I completed an integrity test from https://psychologytoday.tests.psychtests.com. I completed this test as I believe that honesty and integrity are qualities that all employers will think highly of. </p>
 <p>I received an honesty outlook of 78/100. For me, I think that this is a good result and reflects that I am trustworthy. I think that integrity is an important part of any team because you have to be able to trust your teammates. The test is indicative of the fact that people who are inclined to time theft and cyberloafing may be more inclined to take part in dishonest behaviours. If I observed these behaviours in a person, I would be less likely to consider including that person when forming a team.</p>
 

<h1>Project idea</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This watch will help any fisherman know when the best time to fish in the location he or she is in. it will also tell them how long in the day or night they have left. It would have sunup and down times and also major and minor bite times. It would also tell them about the possible fish in the area, and what bait is in the area to give them an idea what bait or lures might work in the area. It would have GPS and you could load in where your going the following day or even in the morning if you were headed somewhere off the grid.</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>As a fisherman, I often find myself off the grid and somewhere new. It is very hard if when you are fishing you don’t know what you are targeting and you don’t know what times you would be most likely to catch them. With this watch you would no what is in the area and when they are likely to be on the bite. If you are on the grid you have to spend the time looking at your phone to find information of the area and the species, this could mean missing your window. With this watch it would only take a glance at your wrist and maybe a few buttons. It would be a game changer.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The fisherman’s watch will allow the wearer and his or her companions a detailed explanation of their locations 
•	tide times – This would tell you exactly when the next change of tide is whether it was high or low tide. It would also tell you the meter that tide would be, for example.
 4:03 pm (down arrow indicating low tide) 0.53m
•	Major and Minor bite periods – Every day there are major and minor bite windows that tell you the ideal time to fish and the “bite percentage” these are a fisherman’s best friend and paired with a bit of knowledge can go a long way.
•	Species – This would tell you what species are known to the area and what habitat they prefer.
•	Bait – this would tell you the bait that’s in the area. For example.
Prawns and juvenile mullet are the main source of bait in this area
•	Sun rise and set times – This would tell you what time the sunset and rise are.
•	The temperature – this would tell tem the high for the day and also the current temperature.

There would need to be some link to your phone in order to get all the information for your area. It would take information from its own database for things like species and bait. But would pull information from other sites for weather information and sunrise and set times. The data base would have all the information for everywhere around the world on it and would keep growing as time went on. There would also be an app with the watch where users can put in what the caught, where they caught it and what they were using as bait. With this watch any user could have all this information at a mere glance of the wrist and would give them an advantage over the fish. It would also let them know how hot it is so they can take all the measures available to be sun smart. 
</p>
<h3>Tools and tech</h3>
<p>The watch hardware would need to be built having Bluetooth, GPS, temperature gauge, touchscreen capabilites and clock. The app would need experiences programmers to write the code for the app and making it linkable to the watch. The database would need a team of researchers looking up the facts needed to put all required information in the and would also need a team of researchers keeping all that data up to date as time went on. It would need testers to test the watch and make sure its working as planned.</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>If this project were successful this watch would be sold at every fishing store around the world. It would allow fisherman the ultimate advantage. It would also come in handy for people caming on the beach by knowing when it is safe to drive on the sand, with no risk of being stuck by the tides. It would also help parents by telling them how hot it is going to be that day whether to pack some sort of shade equipment ect.</p>
